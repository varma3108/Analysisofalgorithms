# Sorting Code Project

This project contains code for sorting algorithms implemented in C++. The project uses a Makefile for building and running the code.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2.  Navigate to the project directory
3.  Build the project using Make



## Usage

After building the project, you can run the sorting program with the following command:

## Project Structure

- `Driver.cpp`: This is the main driver program for the sorting algorithms.
- `Helper.cpp`: This file contains helper functions used by the sorting algorithms.
- `Sorting.hpp`: This header file contains the declarations for the sorting algorithms.
- `Helper.hpp`: This header file contains the declarations for the helper functions.

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the compiled files and executables, use the following command:
